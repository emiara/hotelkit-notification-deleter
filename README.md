# -- Hotelkit Notification Deleter --

Chrome plugin for adding a "delete all" feature to
Hotelkit Notifications.


Works by sending POST requests to the server. It uses only the *notifcations/all* and *notifications/delete* endpoints.



Features:
  - Delete all
  - Delete all notifications except if tagged
  

`I personally think this should be a built in feature, it may be available in other hotels though, I dont know`



Future features:
1. hello
1. world
1. 
# Use responsibly!
